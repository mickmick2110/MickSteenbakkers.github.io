    <h3>About this project:</h3>

    <p>
        Project data was something completely new and quite interesting.
        Together with another developer and a couple of artists, we turned data into a visual and interactive game / page.
        We decided, as a group, to visualize the ammount of plastic in the sea and compare it to other heavy objects to give people a reality check on the current situation from plastic in the sea.
        We compared it tho things such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Busses</li>
        <li>Tanks</li>
        <li>Eifel towers</li>
        <li>Chicken nuggets (yes we actually calculated the ammount of those needed to be equal to the 79 tons of plastic in the sea)</li>
        <li>Sharks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This has been visualized by making multiple of those items scroll across the screen, counting up how many of those objects have passed and their weight being added up in the meanwhile.
        The objects would stop appearing once the total weight has been equal to the ammount of plastic in the ocean.
    </p>

    <p>
        There was only one issue: It took quite a while to let 4157 busses to drive acros the screen.
        To fix this, I came up with the idea to add a slider that would let you speed up the process if you don't like waiting too long.
    </p>

    <p>
        Working together on this project was alot of fun and learned alot of new stuff.
        The artists made it some really nice draawings to help visualise everything.
        And together with the other developer, we made one smoothly running project with a good UI and a bunch of code.
