    <h3>About this project:</h3>

    <p>
        This is where it all began. 
        The very first project that I have made.
        The goal was to completely recreate Pong and give it some new visuals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before i started this project, i had barely any knowledge of C# and Unity.
        The whole reason im so proud of this project, is that i completely made it on my own with barely any help of a teacher.
        Google has been my best friend while working on this project: I managed to find out how to make all of this and solve certain issues i came across.
    </p>

    <p>
        I learned pretty much all of the important basics of C# and Unity, which i nowadays still use and also have been improved by alot since this project.
        Besides that, i also learned how to properly make use of google and find an awnser to most of my coding questions.
        I'm still very gratefull for learning this, since it can save so much time when working on projects.
